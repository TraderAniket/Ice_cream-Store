# Ice_cream-Store  


"Designed and developed a user-friendly ice cream store web application using Django. Implemented essential features, including user authentication with login and signup functionality, a smooth 'make order' process, and an easy-to-use address filling system. Users can browse through a delightful selection of ice cream flavors, create orders, and securely place them with their preferred delivery address. The project showcases my proficiency in Django, web development, and user experience design."
